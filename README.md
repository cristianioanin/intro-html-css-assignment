# HTML/CSS Assignment

## Create an HTML webpage around a topic of your choice

Create an index.html file with the minimal correct HTML structure or as generated by Visual Studio Code
Create other two .html files (contact.html, about.html)
Each page should contain the following elements:

- A navigation element with a list of anchor tags pointing to the other two pages
- One header element with an image (the image positioning is not important for this assignment and you should use different images for each page)
- One heading (of most importance)

### The Home page (index.html) should also contain:

- One paragraph

### The About page should also contain:

- Three paragraphs

### The Contact page should also contain:

- a contact form with the following elements
- an input for inputting an email address
- a dropdown with 3 topics related to your webpage, where the second one is preselected - the selected one is the topic for which we are sending the message
- a text area for inputting the message
- two radio buttons for controlling a Subscribe to newsletter option (Yes/No)
- a checkbox for I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy
- a Send button

Put all files (.html and images, if you're not using external urls) into one archive. Name the archive using the following pattern: your-name-html-homework

Submit the archive for your assignment to be graded.


Good luck!
